# Pharmacy-Management-System
This Pharmacy Management System is developed using jFrame and MySQL for the database. The system has two modules, an admin module and a pharmacist module. The admin module can manage all users, while the pharmacist module can manage all medicines. The admin module's features, includes adding and viewing users, deleting users (excluding the admin user), updating profiles, and updating user roles. The system has validation checks to ensure that fields are entered correctly, such as mobile numbers being ten digits long. The system responds when incorrect data is entered, such as displaying an error message when a user attempts to delete their own account. The system is user-friendly and intuitive, with pop-up windows for adding users and updating profiles.
